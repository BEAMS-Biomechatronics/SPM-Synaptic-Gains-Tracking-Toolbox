# EEG synaptic gains tracking toolbox

***This code is for research purposes only.***

SGTT, a SPM EEG synaptic gains tracking toolbox, allows to:
1. track the average excitatory Ae, slow and fast inhibitory synaptic gains, B and G, by automatically fitting EEG data to a neural mass model;
2. compute four synaptic gain ratios (excitatory/slow inhibitory Ae/B, excitatory/fast inhibitory Ae/G, excitatory/(slow + fast) inhibitory Ae/(B+G), and slow/fast inhibitory ratio B/G, and smooth them using moving average filter;
3. display the path to epilepsy through the synaptic gain space.
